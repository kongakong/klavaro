Version 1.9.7

- Now we are filtering progress charts according to keyboard (basic & adapt)
  or language (velo & fluid). With this, the old progress logs for the
  basic and the adapt modules will not appear anymore, because they
  depend on the current keyboard configured in the main menu, and this
  information wasn't saved before. For the velo and fluid modules, the
  language was already saved in the log files, so no issues with them.
  Anyway, the information will remain there, if the user wants to restore
  it, editing the file directly. See:
   $HOME/.local/share/klavaro/*.txt

- Now we are dismissing keys which are not in the current keyboard (keyset),
  in the error/speed accounting process in the adapt module, for the personal
  practices. Results for these are saved now in specific files, for each
  keyboard, for example as in:
   $HOME/.local/share/klavaro/accuracy.log_querty_us
  or
   $HOME/.local/share/klavaro/proficiency.log_querty_us
  The old information should be preserved in the general files:
   $HOME/.local/share/klavaro/accuracy.log
  and
   $HOME/.local/share/klavaro/proficiency.log
